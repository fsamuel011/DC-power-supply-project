Designed and built a 30 V DC linear bench power supply

A power supply is a great tool for all electrical enthusiasts. My BCIT electrical engineering program included a 4-month course ELEX 1112: Engineering Tools, and a 4-week course ELEX 1102: Electronics Fabrication Tools and Techniques, in which I designed and built a basic power supply.

*My bench power supply!*

I learned how to use AutoCAD 2022 to design the body chassis, Solidworks PCB to design the PCB electrical schematic, and Altium Designer to manually route and verify the PCB component layout. I also learned how to hand-solder SHT and TH components onto a PCB. Reference designs were provided by BCIT. 

The DC power supply provides three DC voltage outputs when powered by a 120VAC 60Hz source. The rated DC output voltages are +5VDC (fixed), -15VDC (fixed), and +20VDC (variable). The rated current at each output is 1A.
